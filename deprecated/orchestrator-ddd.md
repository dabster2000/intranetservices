Act as the coordinator. Steps:
1) Ensure `.claude/out/` exists.
2) Invoke subagents explicitly in this order:
    - Use the repo-cartographer subagent to build the repo map and endpoint/entity listings.
    - Use the feature-miner subagent to cluster features.
    - Use the ddd-aggregate-hunter subagent to score aggregate roots.
3) Merge results and write:
    - `.claude/out/ddd-inventory.md`
    - `.claude/out/ddd-inventory.json`
      Include:
        - Feature list and their endpoints
        - Candidate Aggregates table (root, members, invariants, score)
        - Suggested migration order by (low coupling, high async benefit, test coverage if found)
        - Mermaid overview diagrams.

CONTEXT PRACTICE
- After each phase, read results from disk rather than carrying large history in chat.
- If compaction is imminent, persist a “memo” under `.claude/out/memo-<phase>.md` and continue.
- Prefer citing file+line evidence over long quotes.
