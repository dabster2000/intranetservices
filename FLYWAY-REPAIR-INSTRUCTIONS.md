# Flyway V108 Migration Repair Instructions

## Problem Summary
The V108 migration failed because it tried to create database triggers, which requires SUPER privilege when binary logging is enabled. The migration has been fixed to use application-layer audit logging instead.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Execute the Repair SQL Script

You need to run the repair SQL script against your MariaDB database to mark V108 as successful.

**Option A: Using MariaDB Client (Recommended)**

```bash
# Connect to your database
mysql -h proxy-1728909905479-trustworks-db2.proxy-cm3iylt6ulsl.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
      -u admin \
      -p \
      twservices4 \
      < flyway-repair-v108.sql
```

**Option B: Using Docker with MariaDB Client**

```bash
# Run MariaDB client in Docker
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/scripts \
  mariadb:11 \
  mysql -h proxy-1728909905479-trustworks-db2.proxy-cm3iylt6ulsl.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
        -u admin \
        -p \
        twservices4 \
        -e "$(cat /scripts/flyway-repair-v108.sql)"
```

**Option C: Using IntelliJ Database Console**

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Connect to your database using the Database tool window
3. Open `flyway-repair-v108.sql`
4. Execute the SQL statements

**Option D: Manual SQL Execution**

If you have direct database access, execute this single statement:

```sql
UPDATE flyway_schema_history
SET success = 1, execution_time = 0
WHERE version = '108';
```

### Step 2: Verify the Repair

Check that V108 is now marked as successful:

```sql
SELECT version, description, success, installed_on
FROM flyway_schema_history
WHERE version = '108';
```

You should see `success = 1`.

### Step 3: Restart the Application

After repairing the Flyway schema history, restart your Quarkus application:

```bash
cd intranetservices
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

Or if using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose restart twservices
```

## What Was Changed

### Before (V108 original)
- Created 9 database triggers for automatic audit logging
- Required SUPER privilege (security risk)
- Failed with Error 1419

### After (V108 fixed)
- No database triggers created
- Documents decision to use application-layer audit logging
- Uses JPA EntityListeners (to be implemented)
- No special privileges required
- Follows modern Spring/Quarkus patterns

## Next Steps

The audit logging functionality will be implemented using:
1. JPA `@EntityListeners` on the three override entities
2. Service layer integration with user context
3. REST API for querying audit trails
4. UI components for viewing change history

The `contract_rule_audit` table (created in V106) is ready and waiting for the application code to populate it.

## Verification

After restart, your application should:
- ✅ Start without Flyway errors
- ✅ Show V108 as successful in logs
- ✅ Accept future migrations normally

Check the logs for:
```
Migrating schema `twservices4` to version "108 - Add audit triggers"
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema `twservices4` (execution time 00:00.000s)
```

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify database connectivity
2. Check user permissions (UPDATE privilege on flyway_schema_history)
3. Ensure V108 migration file has been updated
4. Review Flyway logs for detailed error messages
