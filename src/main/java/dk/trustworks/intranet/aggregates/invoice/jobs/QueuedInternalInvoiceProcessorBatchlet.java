/**
 * Processes queued INTERNAL invoices, creating them automatically when their
 * referenced external invoice has been PAID in e-conomics.
 *
 * <p>This batch job runs nightly and:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Finds all INTERNAL invoices with status QUEUED</li>
 *   <li>Checks if their referenced invoice (via invoice_ref) has economics_status = PAID</li>
 *   <li>For each eligible invoice:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>Sets invoicedate to today and duedate to tomorrow</li>
 *       <li>Creates the invoice (assigns number, generates PDF)</li>
 *       <li>Queues uploads to e-conomics for tracking and retry</li>
 *       <li>Attempts uploads to both issuing company and debtor company</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Upload failures are tracked in invoice_economics_uploads table and automatically
 * retried by EconomicsUploadRetryBatchlet with exponential backoff.
